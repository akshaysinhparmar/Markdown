# Markdown
### What is Markdown ? 
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to **add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.**
In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isnâ€™t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.
